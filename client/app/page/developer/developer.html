		Fledit is build at the top of a <strong>REST API</strong> and a 
		<strong>WebSocket</strong> server. This guide lets you discover 
		how to get or post file directly from Fledit.
	</p>

	<h2>REST API</h2>
	<p>
		The API is available on <a href="http://www.fledit.io/api">fledit.io/api</a>.
		As you may guess, every responses and requests use a 
		<code>Content-Type</code> set to <code>application/json</code>. 
		Each writing operation (<em>create</em>, <em>update</em> and <em>delete</em>) 
		comes with rate limitations accordingly. These limitations are applied thtough 
		window of 1 hour chunks for each operation. Finally, Fledit allows 
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/" target="_blank">CORS</a> so you
		can send or read data direclty from your Javascript application.
	</p>

		<span class="label label-info">POST</span>&nbsp;
		/api/files
	</h3>
	<p>
		This operation lets you create an abitrary file. It's particulary usefull 
		if you want to use Fledit as database into your application. Since every
		creation returns an admin <strong>token</strong> that can be use to raise 
		user rights, it is easy to build application with persistent data. 		
	</p>
	<p>
		To create a new file, you'll have to send two parameters:
		<code>content</code> that contains the very content of your file, 
		and optionaly <code>name</code> that holds a name for your file.
	</p>

	<h3 class="developer__endpoint developer__endpoint--get">
		<span class="label label-primary">GET</span>&nbsp;
		/api/files
	</h3>
	<p>
		This operation lets you navigate through every public files. 
		<strong>It is only available during the beta and should be replaced by
		more accurate endpoints soon.</strong>
	</p>

	<h3 class="developer__endpoint developer__endpoint--get">
		<span class="label label-primary">GET</span>&nbsp;
		/api/files/:id
	</h3>
	<p>
		This operation gets you to the last version of a given file. 
		No particular limitation is applied to this endpoint except with the optional parameter 
		<code>secret</code>. This parameter lets you check if a given file matchs with 
		the secret token you send.
	</p>

	<h3 class="developer__endpoint developer__endpoint--put">
		<i class="fa fa-lock pull-right text-muted" tooltip="This operation need authentication"></i>
		<span class="label label-success">PUT</span>&nbsp;
		/api/files/:id
	</h3>
	<p>
		This operation lets you update a given file. To be allowed to edit a file
		you must add a <code>secret</code> parameter in the URL you call. The
		body of the request must contain the whole file to update meaning that
		both <code>content</code> and <code>name</code> must be send. 
		A <em>PATCH</em> method will be soon available.
