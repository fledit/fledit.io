	<h2>1. Description of Service</h2>

	<p>Fledit.io is a data management solution. It lets the User create, update and publish text file.</p>

	<p>The User also understands and agrees that the Service may include certain communications from Fledit, such as but not limited to service announcements and administrative messages, that these communications are considered part of the Service and that the User as long as he or she is registered will not be able to opt out of receiving them.</p>

	<p>Fledit may at any time, at its sole discretion, and without prior notice modify the features of the Service. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Agreement.</p>
	
	<h2>2. Registration</h2>

	<p>Any use of the Service by the User to publish a file will result to the creation an account.</p>

The User agrees to (a) immediately notify Fledit of any unauthorized use of his or her account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that he or she exits from his or her account at the end of each session. In consideration of use of the Service, the User agrees to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about him or herself as prompted by the Service's registration form, and (b) maintain and promptly update the registration data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.

	<h2>3. Usage Policy &amp; ownership of data</h2>

	<p>Fledit does not claim ownership over any content submitted on or through the Service. Content created by the User belongs to the User who created it. However, by uploading any content to the Service, the User agrees that Fledit may store and display (according to the privacy settings chosen by the owner of the Investigation the User contributes to) content created by the User. To the extent the User chooses to share any of his or her content with other users of the Service, the User agrees to allow these users to view the User’s content and, to the extent applicable, collaborate with the User.</p>

	<p>The User understands that all content created by the User is the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. This means that the User, and not Fledit, is entirely responsible for all content that the User uploads, posts, transmits or otherwise makes available via the User’s Account. Fledit does not control the content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such content.</p>

Under no circumstances will Fledit be liable in any way for any data, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any data, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any data posted, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.

Without limiting the foregoing, Fledit and its designees shall have the right to remove any data that violates the Agreement or is otherwise objectionable. The User agrees that he or she must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any data, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such data.

	<p>If Fledit discloses data to comply with legal process or respond to claims that any data violates the rights of third-parties, to the extent permitted by law, regulation or legal process, Fledit agrees to provide the User to whom the data belongs with prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with the User in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure.</p>

	<p>The User acknowledges and agrees that Fledit own all legal rights, title, interest, technology in and to the Service, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Service (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). The User further acknowledges that the Service may contain information which is designated confidential by Fledit and that the User shall not disclose such information without Fledit' prior written consent.</p>

	<p>Unless the User has agreed otherwise in writing with Fledit, nothing in the Terms gives the User a right to use any of Fledit' or Fledit.io's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.</p>

	<h2>5. Payment</h2>

	<p>Advanced features are available in the paid plans. Users can select a paid plan, after which Fledit sends them an invoice to be paid by money transfer. If a payment is overdue, Fledit will disable the User’s access to the features provided by the paid plan. Fledit may, at its sole discretion, at any time and for any reason, terminate the Service, terminate this Agreement, or suspend or terminate a User’s account. In the event of suspension or termination, the User’s account will be disabled and the User may not be granted access to his or her account or any data contained in the User’s account, and Fledit may delete a User’s data, although residual copies of information may remain in Fledit’ system for some time for back-up purposes. In the event of termination, Fledit may also withdraw and at its discretion reallocate the public web address of a User’s Account.</p>

	<p>If a User terminates his or her account, via means provided for cancellation on the Fledit.io website, or via telephone call or email to Fledit, and requests that Fledit deletes his or her data, Fledit will make all reasonable efforts to do so.</p>

	<p>The User must contact Fledit by email to cancel his or her subscription. It is the User’s responsibility to make sure that Fledit received the email signalling the cancellation. If the User cancels his or her subscription within 15 calendar days of the date at which the invoice related to the subscription was issued, and requests a refund, Fledit will refund all payments he or she has made to Fledit within the 15 calendar days prior to the cancellation and refund request. If the User cancels a subscription and requests a refund later than 15 calendar days after the the date at which the invoice related to the subscription was issued, Fledit refunds the User in proportion of the remaining days of the subscription. In other words, refund = amount paid by User * ((date of cancellation - date of invoice) / 360).</p>

This shall include, but not be limited to, any loss of profit (whether incurred directly or indirectly), any loss of goodwill or business reputation, any loss of data suffered, cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, or other intangible loss.</p>

	<p>It is the User's responsibility to personally backup any content uploaded to the Service and keep its accounts details and other sensitive information secure and confidential.</p>

	<p>No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by the User from Fledit or through or from the Service shall create any warranty not expressly stated in the terms. Fledit further expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions of any kind, whether expressed or implied.</p>
